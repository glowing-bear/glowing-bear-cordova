glowing-bear-cordova
====================

Native app for glowing-bear, the HTML5 irc client of the 21st century.

Supports Android, Firefox OS, and iOS (self-deploy only).

You can install the developer preview from the Google Play Store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.glowing_bear).

Getting started
---------------

After cloning this repository, you will need to get the glowing-bear submodule:

`git submodule init && git submodule update`

Secondly, check out the wonderful [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) if you don't know it already, it's highly recommended.

Then, install cordova:

`npm install -g cordova`

Next, you need to have cordova generate all the necessary build files that aren't checked into git:

```bash
cordova platform update android
cordova platform update firefoxos
```

Don't worry about the errors it will spew at you (if you insist on having them disappear, just run the command again. It won't change anything, but this time around, no errors should be found).

Lastly you need to tell cordova about the plugins we use, and then you'll be ready to build!

```bash
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-inappbrowser
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-splashscreen
cordova plugin add de.appplant.cordova.plugin.local-notification
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-statusbar
```

Building for Android
--------------------

Type `cordova build android` to build. Your apk file will end up in the
`/platforms/android/build/outputs/apk/` folder.

Some other commands you might want to have a look at are `cordova emulate` to build and install in an Android emulator instance, or `cordova run` to build and install onto a device (or an emulator). You can also have a look at http://www.ng-newsletter.com/posts/angular-on-mobile.html#native for some more information.

Building for FirefoxOS
----------------------

As FirefoxOS apps are pure web apps, a simple `cordova prepare firefoxos` suffices to copy all the necessary files to the correct places. You can then point your Firefox to `about:app-manager` and add `platforms/firefoxos/www` as a packaged app. Done! If you want to learn more, https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/02/building-cordova-apps-for-firefox-os/ is a great starting point.

Building for iOS
----------------
Due to licensing issues, Glowing Bear can't be published on Apple's App store. Fortunately, you can self-deploy apps to your phone for free (!) as of iOS 9 / Xcode 7.

First, add the platform:

```bash
cordova platform add ios
```

Then, install all the plugins listed above.

Next, open the built `Glowing Bear.xcodeproj` in Xcode. You'll need to change the Bundle Identifier to something unique to get the code signing to work. Otherwise, the default Bundle Identifier will only work in the emulator. Then, follow the steps at http://bouk.co/blog/sideload-iphone/ to deploy it to your physical device.

**Note:** As the Cordova build includes a copy of the GB source, it won't auto update. You'll need to update, recompile, and redeploy to get any new features of Glowing Bear.

Generating Splash Screen / Icons
--------------------------------
Two high-res "template" pngs have been included in `icons\` -- `icon.png` and `splash.png`. From these, a variety of icons and splash screens can be generated for the various platforms, without having to manually create each one. Install `splashicon-generator` from npm and ensure you have ImageMagick installed.


```bash
npm install splashicon-generator -g
```

Then run it from the root project directory, pointing it to the `icons\` directory:

```bash
splashicon-generator --imagespath=icons/
```

See the documentation for `splashicon-generator` at https://github.com/eberlitz/splashicon-generator , including how to set up `config.xml` for various platforms.



Debugging
---------

If you want to attach the browser's debugger, you need to tell Cordova to enable debugging. Do so with `cordova plugin add https://github.com/jrstarke/webview-debug`
